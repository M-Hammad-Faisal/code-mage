# Python Variables in 5 Minutes

Variables are the foundation of any programming language, and Python makes them incredibly simple to work with.

## What is a Variable?

A variable is like a labeled box that stores data. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of variable - Python figures it out automatically!

```python
# Creating variables
name = "Code Mage"
age = 25
is_learning = True
```

## Variable Types

Python has several built-in data types:

- **Strings**: Text data (`"Hello World"`)
- **Integers**: Whole numbers (`42`)
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers (`3.14`)
- **Booleans**: True/False values (`True`, `False`)

## Variable Reassignment

You can change a variable's value at any time:

```python
score = 100
print(score)  # Output: 100

score = 150
print(score)  # Output: 150

# You can even change the type!
score = "Perfect!"
print(score)  # Output: Perfect!
```

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive names: `user_age` instead of `a`
2. Use snake_case for variable names
3. Don't start with numbers: `2name` is invalid
4. Avoid Python keywords: `class`, `def`, `if`, etc.

## Quick Exercise

Try creating variables for:

- Your favorite programming language
- The number of hours you code per day
- Whether you enjoy debugging (True/False)

Remember: Practice makes perfect! üêç‚ú®
